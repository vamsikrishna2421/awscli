Inside the ec2-insance ,awscli is preinstalled.
if u attach a role to ec2 , credentials are available in metadata.
if u want to mention the metadata credentials for a profile , then use:
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata 

EX:
[profile marketingadmin]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata


When an IAM role is attached to the instance, the AWS CLI automatically and securely retrieves the credentials from the instance metadata.
