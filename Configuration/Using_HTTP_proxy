To access AWS through proxy servers, you can configure the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables with either the DNS domain names or IP addresses and port numbers used by your proxy servers.

$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://10.15.20.25:1234
$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:1234
$ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.15.20.25:5678
$ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:5678



The AWS CLI supports HTTP Basic authentication. Specify the user name and password in the proxy URL, as follows.

$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:1234
$ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:5678



Note:

The AWS CLI doesn't support NTLM proxies. If you use an NTLM or Kerberos protocol proxy, you might be able to connect through an authentication proxy like Cntlm.



Using a Proxy on Amazon EC2 Instances
If you configure a proxy on an Amazon EC2 instance launched with an attached IAM role, ensure that you exempt the address used to access the instance metadata. To do this, set the NO_PROXY environment variable to the IP address of the instance metadata service, 169.254.169.254. This address does not vary.

Linux, macOS, or Unix

$ export NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254
